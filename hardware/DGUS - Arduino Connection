Designing the HMI Interface
DGUS Software:
To create a user interface on the DWIN HMI, use the DGUS Software provided by DWIN. This tool allows for designing interactive touch interfaces without extensive programming.

Steps:
Download and install the DGUS Software.
Design the desired interface, incorporating buttons, displays, and other UI elements.
Save the project and transfer it to the HMI via the appropriate method (e.g., SD card).
